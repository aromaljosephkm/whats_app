# Bulk Whatsapp Messenger
## It helps in texting the same message to multiple people at the  same time. 
Since there is no broadcast symbol it makes us feel that we are sending the message personally and also broadcast message gets delivered to them only if our contact is saved by them, this issue can also be resolved. 
Hence during the special occasions like new year and christmas, it becomes much easier even for lazy people to send their wishes and greetings to all their family and friends, 
not only that even for business purposes if we need to send the same message to multiple people it tends to be beneficial. 
By using Tkinter I have put forth a Gui, and using an edited version of sendwhatmsg function in pywhatkit module in my own way, I have  the create this project.
## Everyone is open to collaborate.
